	 - Seth Godin</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>If you need a friend who understands you, a boss that forces you to venture deep in your 
	 non-comfort zone, a wise guru that tells you what needs to be left behind and a sage that
	 proclaims the coming of a new age, then look no further; you will find these shrewd voices
	 all tied together in this magnificent book. Make sure to get this one.</p>

	<button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Fooled by Randomness - Nassim Nicholas Taleb</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>This book gave me a perspective that I unfortunately rarely encounter in others: 
	 you can do everything right and still lose, or do everything wrong and still win. It is 
	 thus not about the outcome; it is about your actions that have lead you there. This important
	 message is central to many of my decisions I make in my life. This book by Taleb helps you 
	 develop such a perspective so you will be able to live in a world one cannot fully understand, 
	 where the results are not always clear markers of performance and where chance seems to play
	 games with our fates. Stop being fooled by randomness!</p>

	 <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>The 48 Laws of Power - Robert Greene</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Besides the fact that all stories in this book gravitate around power. It contains many 
	 life lessons, amazing historical anecdotes. If read in a certain light, the ability to use 
	 power for good. From Caesar to Goethe, Sun-Tzu to Machiavelli, this eye opening book spans 
	 a wide range of human development. If you, like me, would rather be interested in something
	 less egotistical, perhaps Greene’s latest book Mastery will suffice.</p>

	 <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People -
	 Stephen. R. Covey</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>The title of this book doesn’t capture it all. Covey shares with us seven habits one
	 should adapt to become truly effective in whatever you would like to achieve. Of course, 
	 it is not as easy as it sounds. He stresses the fact that we need to go through a paradigm
	 shift – a fundamental change in how we perceive the world and ourselves. This book can be 
	 read as a guide, with practices and everything, to go through the stages in order to make 
	 such a shift happen. Part shock-therapy, part ageless spiritual wisdom, Covey’s book is packed
	 with wisdom that actually makes a difference.</p>
