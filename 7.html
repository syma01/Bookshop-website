		"autobiography" was <br>first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English
		periodical The Monthly Review,<br> when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it 
		as "pedantic".</h3></i>

	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>This diary is very unlike your usual autobiography. Anne Frank was a Jewish girl, who, along
	 with her family and few friends, went into hiding during World War II. This beautiful piece 
	 describes everything that a thirteen year old girl would experience: typical girlhood
	 consciousness, friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic
	 performances. It also states how her life was while in hiding, her emotional roller coasters,
	 her opinions on other people’s behavior, and her loneliness. Her diary ends shortly after her 
	 fifteenth birthday.</p>
