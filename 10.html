        <h3><i>Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions, such as those

     <p>"A delightful book … I should like to have written it myself." — Bertrand Russell. 
	 First published in 1936, this first full-length presentation in English of the Logical
	 Positivism of Carnap, Neurath, and others has gone through many printings to become a classic 
	 of thought and communication. It not only surveys one of the most important areas of modern 
	 thought; it also shows the confusion that arises from imperfect understanding of the uses of
	 language. A first-rate antidote for fuzzy thought and muddled writing, this remarkable book
	 has helped philosophers, writers, speakers, teachers, students, and general readers alike.</p>

	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>This abridged and revised edition of the original book (Springer-Wien-New York: 2001) 
	 offers the only comprehensive history and documentation of the Vienna Circle based on new 
	 sources with an innovative historiographical approach to the study of science. With reference
	 to previously unpublished archival material and more recent literature, it refutes a number
	 of widespread clichés about "neo-positivism" or "logical positivism". Following some insights 
	 on the relation between the history of science and the philosophy of science, the book offers 
	 an accessible introduction to the complex subject of "the rise of scientific philosophy” in its 
	 socio-cultural background and European philosophical networks till the forced migration in 
	 the Anglo-Saxon world.</p>

     <div class="panel">
     <p>When he died in 1930 aged 26, Frank Ramsey had already invented one branch of mathematics 
	 and two branches of economics, laying the foundations for decision theory and game theory.
	 Keynes deferred to him; he was the only philosopher whom Wittgenstein treated as an equal. 
	 Had he lived he might have been recognized as the most brilliant thinker of the century. 
	 This amiable shambling bear of a man was an ardent socialist, a believer in free love, 
	 and an intimate of the Bloomsbury set. For the first time Cheryl Misak tells the full 
	 story of his extraordinary life.</p>
