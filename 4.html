     <div class="panel">
     <p> In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal,
	 and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin.
	 Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now 
	 live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding
	 outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much 
	 larger world of emotional discovery.</p>

     <p>Calcutta, 1919. Captain Sam Wyndham, former Scotland Yard detective, is a new arrival to Calcutta.
	 Desperately seeking a fresh start after his experiences during the Great War, Wyndham has been 
	 recruited to head up a new post in the police force. He is immediately overwhelmed by the heady
	 vibrancy of the tropical city, but with barely a moment to acclimatize or to deal with the
	 ghosts that still haunt him, Wyndham is caught up in a murder investigation that threatens
	 to destabilize a city already teetering on the brink of political insurgency. </p>

     <div class="panel">
     <p> It’s 1843, and Grace Marks has been convicted for her involvement in the vicious murders 
	 of her employer and his housekeeper and mistress. Some believe Grace is innocent; others think
	 her evil or insane. Now serving a life sentence, Grace claims to have no memory of the murders.</p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>As meat loves salt - Maria Mccann</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> In the seventeenth century, the English Revolution is under way. The nation, seething 
	 with religious and political discontent, has erupted into violence and terror. Jacob Cullen 
	 and his fellow soldiers dream of rebuilding their lives when the fighting is over. But the 
	 shattering events of war will overtake them.</p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Beloved - Toni Morrison</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Sethe, its protagonist, was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later 
	 she is still not free. She has too many memories of Sweet Home, the beautiful farm where 
	 so many hideous things happened. And Sethe’s new home is haunted by the ghost of her baby, 
	 who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: Beloved. Filled with 
	 bitter poetry and suspense as taut as a rope, Beloved is a towering achievement.</p>

	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>A true triumph of voice and storytelling, The Book of Night Women rings with both profound 
	 authenticity and a distinctly contemporary energy. It is the story of Lilith, born into slavery 
	 on a Jamaican sugar plantation at the end of the eighteenth century. Even at her birth, the slave 
	 women around her recognize a dark power that they- and she-will come to both revere and fear.</p>
