	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>The story follows ten people who are brought together, for various reasons, to an empty 
	 mansion on an island. The mysterious hosts of this strange party are not present, but left 
	 instructions for two of the ten to tend the house as the housekeeper and cook. As the days 
	 unfold in accordance with the lyrics of a nursery rhyme, each invitee is forced to face the 
	 music (literally) and bear the consequences of their troubling pasts, as death will come for 
	 them one by one. </p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>The Big Sleep - Raymond Chandler</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Raymond Chandler’s idea of mystery strays from conventions — for him it’s less about the 
	 intricate plot and more about the atmosphere and characters. As such, The Big Sleep is no ordinary
	 story: private eye Philip Marlowe gets hired to investigate the blackmailing of Carmen Sternwood,
	 the second daughter of a wealthy general. The further he digs into this messy business, 
	 the more complicated the story gets, as Carmen continues to be blackmailed by others in a
	 web of unexpected relations between the characters. Chandler’s work is complex: his characters 
	 are multi-faceted and his language rich with premonitions of the tragedy about to fall on this
	 family. While the signs he drops are not exactly there to help you find out “who done it”, 
	 it will definitely give you a foreboding awareness that makes it hard to put the book down.  </p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Gone Girl - Gillian Flynn</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> Perhaps better known by its major motion picture adaptation, Gone Girl is the ultimate mystery
	 puzzle for the modern media age. Devoted wife Amy’s sudden disappearance throws Nick Dunne into
	 a hailstorm of suspicion — from her parents to his neighbours to the investigators, everyone leans 
	 towards believing that he is somehow responsible. Nick himself becomes aware of how his wife viewed
	 him, as well as how little he knows of her, when stories of her emerge from friends he’s never 
	 heard of. Even if you’ve failed to keep the media buzz regarding the movie adaptation from 
	 spoiling you, the experience of reading the minds of these unreliable narrators is well-worth
	 picking this one up. </p>

	  Cain</h4>

     <div class="panel">
     <p> The story follows Frank Chambers and his roadside encounter with diner owner Cora Papadakis.
	 Frank ends up working for Cora and her husband and then falling in love with her, despite her 
	 marriage. Frank’s spontaneity gets the better of him when he and Cora decide to sinisterly plot
	 for the breakup of her marriage. Once the plan succeeds, they can stay happily ever after in each 
	 other’s arms… or so they think. </p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4> In Cold Blood - Truman Capote</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> As it’s based on a real-life case that has already been solved, you might think all the 
	 mystery is taken out of Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. Fortunately, that couldn’t be more wrong,
	 because this nonfiction novel is one of the best-selling crime stories of all time. </p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Woman in White - Wilkie Collins</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> As the title suggests, this final character is the key to the mystery that will enshroud 
	 these characters. Set in dimly-lit streets, The Woman in White is as much Gothic horror as it
	 is mystery book, and that’s precisely why the clarity you get when the riddle is solved is so
	 incredibly satisfying. </p>

	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Before there was How To Get Away With Murder and Suits, lawyer-related entertainment came 
	 in the form of criminal cases. Anatomy of a Murder, written by a Supreme Court Justice under 
	 the pseudonym Robert Traver, is such a classic. It follows lawyer Paul Biegler and his defense 
	 of Frederick Manion, who’s accused of murdering an innkeeper. While the case is overwhelmingly 
	 against Manion, his unreliable behavior leaves room for challenges against conviction, and that’s 
	 where Biegler and his seemingly laid-back attitude comes in. This thrilling courtroom drama will 
	 keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering how this lawyer can argue such an impossible case.</p>

	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> Packed with interesting codenames and stressful covert actions, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 
	 is about an ex-spy, George Smiley (codename Beggarman), who is pulled out of retirement, to
	 his relief, to weed out a Soviet mole in the British Intelligence Service. You’ve probably 
	 never seen the motto “Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer” in better action than 
	 this, as Smiley attempts to distinguish the double-agent amidst old partners. There are plenty 
	 of clever hints and details about these cryptically named characters that you can pick up on,
	 thus joining Smiley on the race to safeguard his country. </p>

	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> Dan Brown knows how to write up a riddle — just read The Da Vinci Code 
	 and you’ll see. In this volume, Professor Robert Langdon is brought to Paris on a whirl 
	 to shed some light on a bizarre murder in the Louvre. As he and sidekick cryptologist Neveu 
	 tries to decode the artistic riddles left at the scene, all of which are related to the 
	 works of Leonardo da Vinci, Dan Brown takes readers scrambling through the City of Love, 
	 speechless (because of the shrewd puzzles and not Paris’ beauty, of course). </p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - 
	  Stieg Larsson</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> It appears a mark of a good mystery book is that it has been made into a movie. 
	 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is no exception. The first book of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium 
	 series introduces us to journalist Mikael Blomkvist and freelance hacker Lisbeth Salander. 
	 Following two separate strings of events, the characters eventually find themselves both trying 
	 to find the person who, forty years ago, supposedly killed Harriet Vanger - niece of one of the
	 wealthiest men in Sweden. Blomkvist is invited to stay over at the wealthy family’s island, 
	 where he comes into contact with other family members who were present at the scene years ago, 
	 and begins to wonder if any of them were involved. </p>
