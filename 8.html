        <h3><i>Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction set in a fictional universe,
		often inspired by real <br>world myth and folklore. Its roots are in oral traditions, 
		which then became fantasy <br>literature and drama.</h3></i>

     <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Alice’s Adventures in 
	 Wonderland - Lewis Carroll</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Even if you’re not a math geek, you’re probably familiar with the algebraist Charles
	 Dodgson — you just know him his much more famous alter-ego, Lewis Carroll. Unlike Dodgson, 
	 Carroll wrote stories that defied logic, twisting it into dreamlike, fantastical shapes: 
	 a hookah-smoking caterpillar, a flamingo-filled croquet-ground, a perpetually tardy White Rabbit. 
	 The result was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which has delighted adults and children alike 
	 since it was published over a century and a half ago — and today is recognized as a momentous 
	 early foray into the fantasy genre as a whole.</p>
     </div>
	 <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>The King of Elfland’s 
	 Daughter - Lord Dunsany</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>The King of Elfland’s Daughter is a fairy tale with deep, dark roots — as well as 
	 a love story rendered with piercing emotional honesty. It’s also an unlikely immigration novel, 
	 about an elfin princess’s attempts to deal with her fractured sense of self as she adjusts to
	 the homeland of her beloved human husband. Another remarkably early entry into the 
	 fantasy genre, this book prompted Arthur C. Clarke to name Dunsany as one of the greatest 
	 writers of his century, and World Fantasy Award winner Jane Yolen to call him “the great
	 grandfather of us all.”</p>
     </div>
	 <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>The Hobbit - J.R.R. Tolkien</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>It might be a childhood favorite, but The Hobbit gives adult fantasy readers one of the 
	 genre’s most relatable protagonists: a middle-aged homebody who just wants to chill. 
	 The iconic Bilbo Baggins speaks to all grownup introverts who like nothing more than a
	 good meal and a cozy chair. But we all hope we’d find Bilbo-like reservoirs of heroism 
	 within us — yes, while a career as a Chosen One might be out of reach for us, we can
	 all aspire to be Bilbo Baggins. </p>
     </div>
	 <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>The Sword in the Stone - T.H. White </h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>We all know what happens after King Arthur pulls the sword out of the stone; The Sword 
	 in the Stone takes a look at the before. Predictably, it’s much less glamorous. In this telling,
	 the archetypical fantasy monarch was once just a boy called Wart — teased by his foster-brother 
	 Kay and subjected to a punishing round of lessons that would make any modern high-schooler wince 
	 in sympathy. Only Wart’s education doesn’t involve AP Calculus and JV Track... and his teacher, 
	 Merlyn, prefers to instruct by turning his students into animals instead of grilling them with 
	 the Socratic method.</p>
