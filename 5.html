     <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>A Beautiful Mind - Sylvia Nasar</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> This biography of esteemed mathematician John Nash was both a finalist for the 1998 Pulitzer
	 Prize and the basis for the award-winning film of the same name. Nasar thoroughly explores Nash’s
	 prestigious career, from his beginnings at MIT to his work at the RAND Corporation — as well the 
	 internal battle he waged against schizophrenia, a disorder that nearly derailed his life.</p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Alan Turing: The Enigma - Andrew Hodges</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Hodges’ 1983 biography of Alan Turing sheds light on the inner workings of this brilliant
	 mathematician, cryptologist, and computer pioneer. Indeed, despite the title (a nod to his 
	 work during WWII), a great deal of the “enigmatic” Turing is laid out in this book. It covers 
	 his heroic code-breaking efforts during the war, his computer designs and contributions to
	 mathematical biology in the years following, and of course, the vicious persecution that befell 
	 him in the 1950s — when homosexual acts were still a crime punishable by English law.</p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Alexander Hamilton - Ron Chernow</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Ron Chernow’s Alexander Hamilton is not only the inspiration for a hit Broadway musical, 
	 but also a work of creative genius itself. This massive undertaking of over 800 pages details 
	 every knowable moment of the youngest Founding Father’s life: from his role in the Revolutionary 
	 War and early American government to his sordid (and ultimately career-destroying) affair with 
	 Maria Reynolds. He may never have been president, but he was a fascinating and unique figure
	 in American history — plus it’s fun to get the truth behind the catchy songs.</p>
     </div>
	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black
	  Cargo" - Zora Neale Hurston</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> A prolific essayist, short story writer, and novelist, Hurston turned her hand to biographical
	 writing in 1927 with this incredible work, kept under lock and key until it was published 2018.
	 It’s based on Hurston’s interviews with the last remaining survivor of the Middle Passage slave 
	 trade, a man named Cudjo Lewis. Rendered in searing detail and Lewis’ highly affecting 
	 African-American vernacular, this biography of the “last black cargo” will transport you back
	 in time to an era that, chillingly, is not nearly as far away from us as it feels.</p>
     </div>
	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>Churchill: A Life - Martin Gilbert</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Though many a biography of him has been attempted, Gilbert’s is the final authority on
	 Winston Churchill — considered by many to be Britain’s greatest prime minister ever. 
	 A dexterous balance of in-depth research and intimately drawn details makes this biography 
	 a perfect tribute to the mercurial man who led Britain through World War II.</p>
     </div>
	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"><h4>E=mc²: A Biography of the World's Most
	  Famous Equation - David Bodanis</h4>
	 </font> 
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>This “biography of the world’s most famous equation” is a one-of-a-kind take on the genre:
	 rather than being the story of Einstein, it really does follow the history of the equation itself. 
	 From the origins and development of its individual elements (energy, mass, and light) to their 
	 ramifications in the twentieth century, Bodanis turns what could be an extremely dry subject into
	 engaging fare for readers of all stripes.</p>
