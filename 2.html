	 <div class="panel">
     <p>Cavendish's utopian tale follows the adventures of a kidnapped woman, who travels to 
	    another world run by part-humans, part animals - fox men, fish men, geese men, the list goes 
	    on. As she is a very beautiful woman, she becomes their Empress, and organises an an almighty

     <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"> <h4>Frankenstein - Mary Shelley </h4></font>
	 </button></b></i>
     
	 <div class="panel">
     <p>It is a pro-science novel that at its heart shows Dr Frankenstein as the callous fiend 
	    of the story, who created a being and was not willing to accept responsibility for his actions. 
	    In an age where the space between technical life and death is narrower than ever, and scientists 
	    are playing with the makeup of what makes us humans, Frankenstein can still teach an important 
	    lesson: just because you can, doesn't mean you should.</p>

     <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"> <h4>Foundation - Isaac Asimov</h4></font>
	 </button></b></i>
     
	 <div class="panel">
     <p>The Foundation series follows Hari Seldon, who is the architect of psychohistory – a branch 
	    of mathematics that can make accurate predictions thousands of years in advance, and which Seldon
	    believes is necessary to save the human race from the dark ages. You can see why it’s one of Elon 
	    Musk’s favourite books (along with The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and The Moon is A Harsh
	    Mistress by Robert Heinlein – also recommended). A long-awaited screen adaptation is one of the
	    flagship launch offering’s of Apple’s new streaming service.</p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"> <h4>The Stars My Destination - Alfred Bester </h4></font>
	 </button></b></i>
     
	 <div class="panel">
     <p>This landmark novel begins with a simple proposition – what if humans could teleport? –
	    and sprawls into a tale of rebirth and vengeance that winds across the Solar System: The Count 
	    of Monte Cristo for the interstellar age. First published as Tiger! Tiger! in the UK, named 
	    after the William Blake poem, it follows Gully Foyle – a violent, uneducated brute who spends 
	    six months marooned in deep space, and the rest of the book seeking retribution for it.</p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"> <h4>Solaris - Stanislaw Lem</h4></font>
	 </button></b></i>
    
	<div class="panel">
     <p>If you think you know Solaris from the 2002 Steven Soderbergh film, the original book 
	    may come as a bit of a surprise. Written by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem in 1961, this short 
	    novel is heavier on philosophy than plot. It follows a team of humans on a space station who 
	    are trying to understand the mysterious living ocean on the planet Solaris, with little success
	    – their research is limited to lengthy descriptions that paint a vibrant picture of the alien 
	    planet but fail to elucidate how it works. As they poke and prod, Solaris ends up exposing more
	    about them than it does about itself, with the book demonstrating the futility of humans trying
	    to comprehend something not of their world. </p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"> <h4>Dune - Frank Herbert</h4></font>
	 </button></b></i>
     
	 <div class="panel">
     <p>In 2012, WIRED US readers voted Dune the best science-fiction novel of all time. It’s also 
	    the best-selling of all time, and has inspired a mammoth universe, including 18 books set over
	    34,000 years and a terrible 1984 movie adaptation by David Lynch, his worst film by far. 
	    A hopefully better effort is currently in production, directed by Denis Villeneuve. 
	    The series is set 20,000 years in the future in galaxies stuck in the feudal ages, where 
	    computers are banned for religious reasons and noble families rule whole planets. We focus 
	    on the planet Arrakis, which holds a material used as a currency throughout the Universe 
	    for its rarity and mind-enhancing powers. Lots of giant sandworms, too. </p>

	 </h4></font>
	 </button></b></i>
     
	 <div class="panel">
     <p>One of Elon Musk's favourite books, apparently, this gripping novel paints a plausible picture 
	    of life on Earth's satellite, three years before man set foot on the moon for the first time. 
	    Its depictions of the challenges of life in orbit, and the ingenuity of human solutions to the 
	    problem – even among the exiles and misfits who make up the lunar population – are memorable.</p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"> <h4>Ice - Anna Kavan</h4></font>
	 </button></b></i>
    
	<div class="panel">
     <p>Anna Kavan's last (and best) sci fi novel provides a haunting, claustrophobic vision of the 
	    end of the world, where an unstoppable monolithic ice shelf is slowly engulfing the earth and killing 
	    everything in its wake. The male protagonist and narrator of the story (who is nameless) is eternally 
	    chasing after an elusive and ethereal young woman, while contemplating feelings that become darker and
	    more violent towards her as the ice closes in. He frequently crosses paths with the Warden, the 
	    sometimes-husband but also captor of the young woman, who is always one step ahead. And as the ice 
	    closes off almost all paths by land and sea, he is running out of time to catch them up. The novel 
	    reads like a grown-up, nightmarish version of Alice in Wonderland: Kavan takes you on a journey that 
	    is hallucinogenic and unsettling, with no regard to whether the narrator is dreaming or awake. 
	    But the true genius of the book is its language - depicting a powerful allegory crushing pain of 
	    addiction, loneliness and mental illness will do little to cheer you up, but will capture 
	    your attention.</p>

	  <button class="accordion"><b><i><font color="#0B3B24"> <h4>The Left Hand of Darkness -
	  Ursula K. Le Guin</h4></font>
	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> Le Guin alternated between genres during her prolific career, and this intricate
	 novel came out the year after the classic fantasy book A Wizard of Earthsea. The bulk 
	 of the action takes place on Winter, a remote Earth-like planet where it’s cold all year 
	 round, and everyone is the same gender. It was one of the first novels to touch on ideas 
	 of androgyny – which is viewed from the lens of protagonist Genly Ai, a visitor from Earth 
	 who struggles to understand this alien culture.</p>

	 </button></b></i>
     <div class="panel">
     <p> A curious novel that reads less like sci-fi and more like a hallucinated autobiography 
	 detailing the author’s struggle with drug addiction. In a near-future California, vice cop 
	 Bob Arctor lives undercover with a community of drug addicts hooked on devastating psychoactive
	 dope Substance D. Arctor, who needs to don a special “scramble suit” to hide his face and voice
	 when meeting his fellow cops, has to grapple with gradually losing his sense of self.</p>
